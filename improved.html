			<h2>Navbar/header</h2>
			<ul>
        
				<li> Got rid of unnecessary scroll down options/links in Publications and Biospecimen Repository</li>
				
				<li>Fixed the "About" section of the nav bar by changing its class to match the rest of the navbar items
        
				</li>

			<h2>People page</h2>
			<ul>
        
				<li>Way too much scrolling and text was way to small so organized it into cards. Each picture now has info on each person and there is a button that opens up the model that includes
				their name, and information about them(was origionally under the image). Basically edited format of info and made it take less scrolling to get to each person.</li>
				
			</ul>

			<h2>Biospecimen Repository</h2>
			<ul>
        
				<li>Made images less blurry and smaller.</li>
				
				<li>Fixed an issue where the closing pharagraph tag was shown as part of the pharagraph in the website.</li>
				
			</ul>

			<h2>Giving Back</h2>
			<ul>
        
				<li> Originally the whole page was 2 columns, and we broke a colum down and made it into a row at the bottom of the page.</li>
				
				<li>Got ride of a link that didn't work	</li>
				
				<li>seperated information into bullet points</li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h2>UREP</h2>
			<ul>
        
				<li> Put pictures into cards(people and introductions). Put descriptions into accordions. </li>
