                     Dr. Julia Carter studied at Wellesley College, where she earned a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy with a minor in Chemistry. Wood Hudson’s Undergraduate Research Education Program (UREP) was developed as a result of her experience as an undergraduate summer intern at the Cancer Research Institute of New England Deaconess Hospital. For three years after graduation, she continued to work in cancer research at the Cancer Research Institute under two Harvard Medical School professors, a professor of Pathology and a professor of Biochemistry. Dr. Carter earned her Master’s degree and Ph.D. in Physiology at Rutgers University, and then completed post-doctoral training at Rutgers under the Director of The Bureau of Biological Research. Life and jobs took the Carter family to Cleveland, where Dr. Julia Carter, Dr. Harry Carter, Dr. Larry Douglass and Mr. Sidney Wood founded Wood Hudson in 1981 as a not-for-profit laboratory dedicated to cancer research. In 1984 the lab moved to Covington, KY, and then in 1990 to Newport, KY, where it has thrived. Dr. Carter has served as Principal Investigator on five U.S. EPA funded cooperative research agreements as well as on research agreements with five pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
